## What is this?
This project provides you with a library of functions for running sophisticated Bayesian analyses in a simple, straight forward manner, all in Python. 

## Why is this useful?
By wrapping Bayesian generalized linear models that are analogous to some of the most commonly used statistical tests in the behavioral and neural sciences (think t-tests, ANOVAs, regression) into functions, BST provides you with the tools for utilizing and exploring Bayesian statistics in your own research projects right away.

In addition, I have included example use cases for almost every model provided, so you can see for yourself what a sensible Bayesian data analysis pipeline looks like. 

Tests were performed on Kruschke data. 


## How do I get started?
To get started, you will first want to first install a new virtual environment with all of the necessary dependencies.

To ensure you can access the new environment from Jupyter: (Is there a way around this?)
