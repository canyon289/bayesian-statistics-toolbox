All of the data and images are from the website for John K. Kruschke's textbook [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).  

The notebooks are adaptations of Jordi Warmenhoven's excellent [PyMC3 port of the textbook](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python). My goal is to show you how to use the BST functions and how to take advantage of some of the new functionality afforded by [PyMC 4.0](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html).   

More complete examples to come soon!
