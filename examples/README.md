# Bayesian Statistics Toolbox (BST) examples

All of the data and images are from the website for John K. Kruschke's textbook [Doing Bayesian Data Analysis: A Tutorial with R, JAGS, and Stan](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).  

The notebooks are adaptations of Jordi Warmenhoven's excellent [PyMC3 port of the textbook](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/DBDA-python) as well as one from the PyMC developers. The notebooks are meant as example use cases that show how the BST functions are used and how to take advantage of some of the new functionality afforded by [PyMC 4.0](https://www.pymc.io/welcome.html) in combination with ArviZ.
